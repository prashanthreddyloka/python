2048 Game in Python
Welcome to my 2048 Game project! This is a Python implementation of the popular puzzle game 2048, built using the pygame library. The goal of the game is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them, ultimately reaching the 2048 tile. Itâ€™s a fun and challenging game that tests your strategic thinking and planning skills.

**Features**
Classic 2048 Gameplay: Slide tiles in four directions (up, down, left, right) to merge matching numbers.

**Score Tracking:** Keep track of your score as you merge tiles.

**High Score:** Compete with yourself to beat your highest score.

**Win/Lose Conditions:**

**Win:** Reach the 2048 tile to win the game.

**Lose:** The game ends when there are no more valid moves.

**Restart Button:** Easily restart the game with a click of a button.

**Sleek UI:**
A clean and modern interface with a semi-transparent restart button.
A subtle 2048 background behind the score display.
**Welcome Screen**: A welcoming message with instructions to start the game.
How to Play
Use the arrow keys to move the tiles:

Up, Down, Left, Right.

Merge tiles with the same number to create higher numbers.

Reach the 2048 tile to win the game.

If no more moves are possible, the game ends.
